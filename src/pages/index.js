        <h2>THE HISTORY</h2>
        <p>Back in their natural habitat, Yakuza Raptorz were considered as one the most threatening and savage creatures 
            ever to exist, mainly because of their<br /> outstanding agility and their ability to think quicker when in danger.
            The Meishu Raptor is known by many for his military intelligence. <br /> His sagacious tactics have helped the Yakuza
            Raptorz to capture an ample amount of territories, rumors has it that his claws which <br />is famously known as 
            Tsume is sharper than a diamond and can tear of  the enemies throats with <br />minimal efforts.One of the greatest wars
            which will be printed forever in the history was fought  by the Yakuza Raptorz <br /> against the Jindai Mosasaurus, 
            The great war lasted for a decade, after shedding a lot of <br /> $BLOOD, Meishu Raptor managed to seal the victory for 
            the Yakuza Raptorz by ripping off the Rura Mosasaurus’s throat.<br />“Anyone who stands against the Yakuza Raptorz 
            will be shredded into pieces” <br />screams the Meishu Raptor with his aggressive voice.
        </p>
        <h2>AT AREA 51</h2>
        <p>
            There was a very luminous beam of light reaching the sky from the middle of the most dubious place, The Area 51;
             the light was so intense that it would have<br /> probably blinded anyone who witnessed it. This was the consequence 
             of an accidental time-travel experiment<br /> by one of the over-ambitious scientists who created a time-warp and 
             brought <br/>1111 Yakuza Raptorz to the present through the time-warp.
        </p>
        <h2>AT THE ANTIPODES ISLANDS</h2>
        <p>
            A group of Yakuza Raptorz led by The Meishu Raptor are so nauseous due to the forceful eviction from their
             previous habitat, <br/>which is making them more enraged than ever.Meishu Raptor commands with his valiant voice <br/>
            “We’ll conquer and paint this place with $BLOOD”.

        </p>
        <p>Seems like nature is completely against the Raptorz, The Rocks start to collapse at the top of Mount Galloway,
            the Landslides down, taking <br/>The Meishu Raptor swiftly to the bottom of the Mount Galloway. The Yakuza Raptorz are 
            hout their king, <br/>
            “You are the only hope we have, pave the path to the glory“ <br/>
            says the Kwen Raptor to the Musuko Raptor.<br/>
            The Musuko Raptor orders the crew<br/>
            “Let’s attack the Gatteville-le-Phare village without any clemency and savor the taste of the $BLOOD”
        </p>
        <h2>THE RETURN OF MEISHU RAPTOR</h2>
        <p>
            The Meishu Raptor manages to return back to the top of Mount Galloway after days of struggle, with a permanent <br/>
            scar in his raging heart. Before the Yakuza raptorz could rejoice the return of their beloved king, there is one <br/>
            more attack on the Raptorz by the Yukan Theros, this time it’s the Kwen Raptor who is in danger.
        </p>
        <h2>THE GREAT WAR</h2>
        <p>
            The intrepid troop of Yakuza Raptorz led by the daring king Meishu Raptor and the Yukan Theros are ready to face <br/>
            each other in the battlefield. Musuko Raptor is very nervous since this is the first battle for him, but still he<br/>
             carries the pain of Kwen Raptor in his heart, as he faces the most beautiful and courageous Musume Thero in the <br/>
             battlefield full of $BLOOD, he says to himself <br/>
             “I have never seen a Thero with such poise and audacity”<br/>
             The pain and anger in the heart of Musuko Raptor turns into hideous love filled with lust towards the Musume<br/>
            Thero. The Musuko Raptor manages to impress the Musume Thero with his flawless yet innocent moves. Even though <br/>
            the relationship between the Mususko Raptor and Musume Thero was hideous, it brought peace to the universe. <br/>
            The Yakuza Raptorz and the Yukan Theros have come to an agreement and decided to live as a single community in <br/>
            the Antipodes Islands
